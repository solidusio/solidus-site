    <h2>Solidus is a Fork of Spree Commerce</h2>

    <p>We liked the Spree platform, but were unable to fix the problems we saw were preventing the platform from being it's best. In 2014 we decided that the only successful path forward depended on forking (taking a copy of the code) and improving it independent of Spree Commerce.</p>

    <p>Solidus aims to differentiate itself with high quality, secure, scalable code in every commit. Solidus is built for professionally-developed, high transaction stores with customized workflows.</p>
