        <p><strong>Secure</strong></p>
        <p>
          We're committed improving the security of all stores, from introducing a configurable role permissions system
          to fixing vulnerabilities, which are announced on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/solidus-security">solidus-security</a> mailing list.

        <p><strong>Take the Easy Path</strong></p>
        <p>A clear and straightforward migration path has been created to move existing Spree stores onto the Solidus platform with ease. Read our <a href="https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/wiki/Versioning">Version guidelines</a> guidelines for details.</p>
