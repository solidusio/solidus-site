  <h2>Technical Goals &amp; Plans</h2>

  <p>Our fork will focus on fixing the pain points we've experienced in our years of developing against Spree.</p>

  <div class="project-plans-wrapper">
    <div class="project-plans">
      <div class="project-plan">
        <p><strong>Open Source You Can Trust</strong></p>
        <p>Code integrity is the top priority. All pull-requests are reviewed by multiple contributors and verified by our test suite before being merged into the project to ensure a clean and stable codebase.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="project-plan">
        <p><strong>Easy Extensibility</strong></p>
        <p>No more <code>class_eval</code>. Well defined extension points allow for safe and simple customizations while still ensuring smooth upgrades from one version to the next.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="project-plan">
        <p><strong>More Secure</strong></p>
        <p>
          We're committed to improving the security of all stores, from introducing a configurable role permissions system
          to fixing vulnerabilities, which are announced on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/solidus-security">solidus-security</a> mailing list.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="project-plan">
        <p><strong>API Stability</strong></p>
        <p>We intend to introduce clearly defined and stable APIs (both HTTP and ruby) which won't change or go away.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="project-plan">
        <p><strong>Take the Easy Path</strong></p>
        <p>A clear and straightforward migration path has been created to move existing Spree stores onto the Solidus platform with ease. Read our <a href="https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/wiki/Versioning">Version guidelines</a> guidelines for details.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="project-plan">
        <p><strong>This Is Our Business Too</strong></p>
        <p>Our core contributors rely on Solidus every day. We are as much invested in itâ€™s success as anyone can be and will continue to be the most active supporters and contributors of the project.</p>
