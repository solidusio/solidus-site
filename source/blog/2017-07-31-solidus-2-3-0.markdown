## Solidus 2.3.0

- Rails 5.1 [\#1895](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/1895) ([jhawthorn](https://github.com/jhawthorn))

- The default behaviour for selecting the current store has changed. Stores are now only returned if their url matches the current domain exactly (falling back to the default store) [\#2041](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/2041) [\#1993](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/1993) ([jhawthorn](https://github.com/jhawthorn), [kennyadsl](https://github.com/kennyadsl))

- Remove dependency on premailer gem [\#2061](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/2061) ([cbrunsdon](https://github.com/cbrunsdon))

- Order#outstanding_balance now uses reimbursements instead of refunds to calculate the amount that should be paid on an order. [#2002](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/2002) (many contributors :heart:)

- Renamed bogus payment methods [\#2000](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/2000) ([tvdeyen](https://github.com/tvdeyen))
  `Spree::Gateway::BogusSimple` and `Spree::Gateway::Bogus` were renamed into `Spree::PaymentMethod::SimpleBogusCreditCard` and `Spree::PaymentMethod::BogusCreditCard`

- Transform the relation between TaxRate and TaxCategory to a Many to Many [\#1851](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/1851) ([vladstoick](https://github.com/vladstoick))

  This fixes issue [\#1836](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/issues/1836). By allowing a TaxRate to tax multiple categories, stores don't have to create multiple TaxRates with the same value if a zone doesn't have different tax rates for some tax categories.
