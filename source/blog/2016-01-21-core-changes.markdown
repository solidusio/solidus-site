We are saddened to announce that Magnus von Koeller will be leaving the Solidus core team. Magnus has left Bonobos and doesn't feel he will have the time at his new job to devote the time and effort needed to the Solidus core team.

We would like to extend our thanks to Magnus for his help on getting Solidus up and running over the last year. His guidance and insight have been extremely valuable in getting this project to where it is today.

In much brighter news [Thomas von Deyen](https://github.com/tvdeyen) from [magic labs](http://magiclabs.de/) will be joining the team. In addition to his years of experience with Spree, Thomas created and continues to maintain the [AlchemyCMS](https://github.com/AlchemyCMS) project. His knowledge of European commerce and amazing attention to detail has already proven invaluable to the project and we are thrilled to have him on board.
