**Please give us a quick introduction for those who don't know you**

I'm John Hawthorn. I work at Stembolt in Victoria, the only warm place in
Canada. I've been using Ruby and Rails since 2009.

**What do you use Solidus for?**

I've previously worked on a few Spree stores. Since its creation, I've had the
pleasure of working on Solidus full time as an open source project.

**What is your talk going to be about?**

Every store using Solidus needs some level of customization. Though it's easy to
hack in some changes, it's harder to make customizations which will work across
Solidus versions and can be shared across stores as an extension.

I'll be discussing some techniques and strategies we've used to try and make
extensions better, easier and more compatible.

**What are you most looking forward to at SolidusConf?**

It's always great to put faces to names from Slack and Github, as well as see
some familiar faces.

**Do you have any other plans for London?**

This is my first time in the UK. I like to experience new places by their foods,
so I'm hoping to have a full English breakfast, a pint of bitter, and copious
amounts of tea.

**Great thank you very much!**
