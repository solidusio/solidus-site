Ecommerce consultants [Blue Stout](http://bluestout.com/) have recently taken the time to write [Spree vs Solidus: A complete guide to choosing between platforms](http://bluestout.com/blog/spree-vs-solidus-ecommerce-platforms). The article includes a brief summary of open source code and breaks down what Spree and Solidus are doing before listing the pros and cons of each. Allen Burt, CEO and founder of Blue Stout writes, &ldquo;[Solidus] is Spree 2.4, but better - Solidus has improved the product immensely.&rdquo; Thanks Allen, we couldn&rsquo;t agree more!

We&rsquo;re happy to see excitment in the community about the progress we&rsquo;ve been making and hope the attention attracts contributors and new stores. Those interested in making the switch can read the [release notes](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/wiki/Upgrading-from-Spree) on the GitHub repository.
