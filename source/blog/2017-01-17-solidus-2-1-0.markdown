I'm happy to announce the release of Solidus 2.1.0!

An exciting change in this release is taxes are now always fully recalculated on an `order.update!`. `order.create_tax_charge!` is no longer required! We hope that this is simpler for developers and should help us better support external tax services in the future.

Also notable in this release the removal of methods which were deprecated before Solidus 1.4. We've also extracted `solidus_prototype` and `solidus_trackers` into separate extensions.

## Changelog


*   The OrderUpdater (as used by `order.update!`) now fully updates taxes.

    Previously there were two different ways taxes were calculated: a "full"
    and a "quick" calculation. The full calculation was performed with
    `order.create_tax_charge!` and would determine which tax rates applied and
    add taxes to items. The "quick" calculation was performed as part of an
    order update, and would only update the tax amounts on existing line items
    with taxes.

    Now `order.update!` will perform the full calculation every time.
    `order.create_tax_charge!` is now deprecated and has been made equivalent
    to `order.update!`.

    [#1479](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/1479)

*   `ItemAdjustments` has been merged into the `OrderUpdater`

    The previous behaviour between these two classes was to iterate over each
    item calculating promotions, taxes, and totals for each before moving on to
    the next item. To better support external tax services, we now calculate
    promotions for all items, followed by taxes for all items, etc.

    [#1466](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/1466)

*   Make frontend prices depend on `store.cart_tax_country_iso`

    Prices in the frontend now depend on `store.cart_tax_country_iso` instead of `Spree::Config.admin_vat_country_iso`.

    [#1605](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/1605)

*   Deprecate methods related to Spree::Order#tax_zone

    We're not using `Spree::Order#tax_zone`, `Spree::Zone.default_tax`,
    `Spree::Zone.match`, or `Spree::Zone#contains?` in our code base anymore.
    They will be removed soon. Please use `Spree::Order#tax_address`,
    `Spree::Zone.for_address`, and `Spree::Zone.include?`, respectively,
    instead.

    [#1543](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/1543)

*   Product Prototypes have been removed from Solidus itself.

    The new `solidus_prototype` extension provides the existing functionality. [#1517](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/1517)

*   Analytics trackers have been removed from Solidus itself.

    The new `solidus_trackers` extension provides the existing functionality. [#1438](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/1438)

*   Bootstrap row and column classes have replaced the legacy skeleton classes throughout the admin. [#1484](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/1484)

*   Remove `currency` from line items.

    It's no longer allowed to have line items with different currencies on the
    same order. This makes storing the currency on line items redundant, since
    it will always be considered the same as the order currency.

    It will raise an exception if a line item with the wrong currency is added.

    This change also deletes the `currency` database field (String)
    from the `line_items` table, since it will not be used anymore.

    [#1507](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/1507)

*   Add `Spree::Promotion#remove_from` and `Spree::PromotionAction#remove_from`

    This will allow promotions to be removed from orders and allows promotion
    actions to define how to reverse their side effects on an order.

    For now `PromotionAction` provides a default remove_from method, with a
    deprecation warning that subclasses should define their own remove_from
    method.

    [#1451](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/1451)

*   Remove `is_default` boolean from `Spree::Price` model

    This boolean used to mean "the price to be used". With the new
    pricing architecture introduced in 1.3, it is now redundant and can be
    reduced to an order clause in the currently valid prices scope.

    [#1469](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/1469)

*   Remove callback `Spree::LineItem.after_create :update_tax_charge`

    Any code that creates `LineItem`s outside the context of OrderContents
    should ensure that it calls `order.update!` after doing so.

    [#1463](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/1463)

*   Mark `Spree::Tax::ItemAdjuster` as api-private [#1463](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/1463)

*   Updated Credit Card brand server-side detection regex to support more
    brands and MasterCard's new BIN range. [#1477](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/1477)

    Note: Most stores will be using client-side detection which was updated in
    Solidus 1.2

*   `CreditCard`'s `verification_value` field is now converted to a string and
    has whitespace removed on assignment instead of before validations.

*   The `lastname` field on `Address` is now optional. [#1369](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/1369)

*   The admin prices listings page now shows master and variant prices
    seperately. This changes `@prices` to `@master_prices` and `@variant_prices` in prices_controller

    [#1510](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/1510)

*   Admin javascript assets are now individually `require`d using sprockets
    directives instead of using `require_tree`. This should fix issues where
    JS assets could not be overridden in applications. [#1613](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/1613)

*   The admin has an improved image upload interface with drag and drop. [#1553](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/1553)

*   PaymentMethod's `display_on` column has been replaced with `available_to_users` and `available_to_admin`.
    The existing attributes and scopes have been deprecated.

    [#1540](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/1540)

*   ShippingMethod's `display_on` column has been replaced with `available_to_users`.
    The existing attributes and scopes have been deprecated.

    [#1611](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/1611)

*   Added experimental Spree::Config.tax_adjuster_class

    To allow easier customization of tax calculation in extensions or
    applications.

    This API is *experimental* and is likely to change in a future version.

    [#1479](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/1479)

*   Removals

    * Removed deprecated `STYLE_image` helpers from BaseHelper [#1623](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/1623)

    * Removed deprecated method `Spree::TaxRate.adjust` (not to be confused with
      Spree::TaxRate#adjust) in favor of `Spree::Config.tax_adjuster_class`.

      [#1462](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/1462)

    * Removed deprecated method `Promotion#expired?` in favor of
      `Promotion#inactive?`

      [#1461](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/1461)

    * Removed nested attribute helpers `generate_template`, `generate_html`,
      and `remove_nested`. Also removes some javascript bound to selectors
      `.remove`, `a[id*=nested]`.

    * Removed `accept_alert` and `dismiss_alert` from CapybaraExt.
      `accept_alert` is now a capybara builtin (that we were overriding) and
      `dismiss_alert` can be replaced with `dismiss_prompt`.

    * Removed deprecated delegate_belongs_to
