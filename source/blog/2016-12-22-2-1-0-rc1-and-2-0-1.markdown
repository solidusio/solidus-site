We have two new Solidus versions: Solidus 2.0.1 and Solidus 2.1.0.rc1.

Solidus 2.0.1 contains only a small fix to support the upcoming [Ruby 2.4.0](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2016/12/12/ruby-2-4-0-rc1-released/), which Matz usually [wraps under the tree with care](https://blog.heroku.com/ruby-2-3-0-on-heroku-with-matz#ruby-releases-happen-every-year-on-christmas-day-why-christmas). The recently released [Rails 5.0.1](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2016/12/21/Rails-5-0-1-has-been-released/) is required for ruby 2.4.0.

Solidus 2.1.0.rc1 will become Solidus 2.1.0 if there aren't major issues.

You can read more about both on the [github releases page](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/releases).

We'll be back in the new year to release Solidus 2.1.0 final. Until then, happy holidays and a happy new year.
