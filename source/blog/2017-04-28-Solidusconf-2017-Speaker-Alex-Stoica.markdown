**Please give us a quick introduction for those who don’t know you**

I’m Alex, a backend developer at Lost My Name. I’ve worked here for just under three years now, while studying towards my Computer Science degree from King’s College London.

**How long have you been working with Spree and Solidus?**

I had my introduction to Spree a few days after I started, so that would make it close to three years.

**What sort of work do you do on a daily basis?**

Over time I have done a bit of everything from fixing Spree or Solidus bugs, to launching new products, or developing external API’s. However, most of the time I work deep into the depths of Solidus - trying to work out why our system is not behaving correctly, or how we can tap into new optimizations made available in the latest patches.

**I imagine you have some fun and perhaps terrible stories there. Could you give us an overview of what you're going to be speaking about at SolidusConf this year?**

I’ll speak about some of the issues we have had in the past about global shipping and how we tackled them. Shipping from 10 different places with loads of ways to ship things is not something that just works. To make things even more complicated, we also have customizable products. So I’ll dip into that a bit and try to show how we managed that complexity and how we now have a streamlined process for launching new products.

**That should be interesting. I'm looking forward to it. What else are you looking forward to at the conference?**

I quite liked the hack days last year, and also being around people that are using Solidus or Spree and understanding their love/hate relationship was great!

**Glad to hear it. Is there anything that you would recommend for the non-London locals who are coming to town? What is something they should consider doing when not at the conference?**

Not being a London local myself for too long I’d definitely recommend walking in some of the parks, if the weather is permitting! Also, taking the river boat can be quite nice.

**That sounds fun. Is there anything else that you wanted to mention before we wrap up?**

I'm really looking forward to the conference and seeing what everyone else is doing with Solidus! Glad to have you guys in London.

**Excellent. Thanks for your time today.**
