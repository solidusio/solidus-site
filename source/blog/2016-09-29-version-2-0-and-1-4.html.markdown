Solidus versions 2.0.0 and 1.4.0 are out!

Solidus 2.0.0 is our first release supporting Rails 5. See [the Rails
documentation](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html#upgrading-from-rails-4-2-to-rails-5-0)
on how to upgrade to Rails 5.

Solidus 1.4.x will be our last minor release series on Rails 4.2. To ease
upgrades to Rails 5, 1.4.0 and 2.0.0 share almost the same code, with the
only [changes between the two
versions](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/compare/v1.4.0...v2.0.0) being
Rails 5 related.

A big thanks to everyone who contributed code or feedback to make these these
releases great.

## Solidus 1.4.0 changelog


*   Use in-memory objects in OrderUpdater and related areas.

    Solidus now uses in-memory data for updating orders in and around
    OrderUpdater.  E.g. if an order already has `order.line_items` loaded into
    memory when OrderUpdater is run then it will use that information rather
    than requerying the database for it. This should help performance and makes
    some upcoming refactoring easier.

    Warning:  If you bypass ActiveRecord while making updates to your orders you
    run the risk of generating invalid data.  Example:

        order.line_items.to_a
        order.line_items.update_all(price: ...)
        order.update!

    Will now result in incorrect calculations in OrderUpdater because the line
    items will not be refetched.

    In particular, when creating adjustments, you should always create the
    adjustment using the adjustable relationship.

    Good example:

        line_item.adjustments.create!(source: tax_rate, ...)

    Bad examples:

        tax_rate.adjustments.create!(adjustable: line_item, ...)
        Spree::Adjustment.create!(adjustable: line_item, source: tax_rate, ...)

    We try to detect the latter examples and repair the in-memory objects (with
    a deprecation warning) but you should ensure that your code is keeping the
    adjustable's in-memory associations up to date. Custom promotion actions are
    an area likely to have this issue.

*   Make some 'wallet' behavior configurable

    NOTE: `Order#persist_user_credit_card` has been renamed to
    `Order#add_payment_sources_to_wallet`. If you are overriding
    `persist_user_credit_card` you need to update your code.

    The following extension points have been added for customizing 'wallet'
    behavior.

    * Spree::Config.add_payment_sources_to_wallet_class
    * Spree::Config.default_payment_builder_class

    https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/1086

*   Backend: UI, Remove icons from buttons and tabs

*   Backend: Deprecate args/options that add icons to buttons

*   Update Rules::Taxon/Product handling of invalid match policies

    Rules::Taxon and Rules::Product now require valid match_policy values.
    Please ensure that all your Taxon and Product Rules have valid match_policy
    values.

*   Fix default value for Spree::Promotion::Rules::Taxon preferred_match_policy.

    Previously this was defaulting to nil, which was sometimes interpreted as
    'none'.

*   Deprecate `Spree::Shipment#address` (column renamed)

    `Spree::Shipment#address` was not actually being used for anything in
    particular, so the association has been deprecated and delegated to
    `Spree::Order#ship_address` instead. The database column has been renamed
    `spree_shipments.deprecated_address_id`.

    https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/1138

*   Coupon code application has been separated from the Continue button on the Payment checkout page

    * JavaScript for it has been moved from address.js into its own `spree/frontend/checkout/coupon-code`
    * Numerous small nuisances have been fixed [#1090](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/1090)

*   Allow filtering orders by store when multiple stores are present. [#1149](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/1140)

*   Remove unused `user_id` column from PromotionRule. [#1259](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/1259)

*   Removed "Clear cache" button from the admin [#1275](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/1275)

*   Adjustments and totals are no longer updated when saving a Shipment or LineItem.

    Previously adjustments and total columns were updated after saving a Shipment or LineItem.
    This was unnecessary since it didn't update the order totals, and running
    order.update! would recalculate the adjustments and totals again.
