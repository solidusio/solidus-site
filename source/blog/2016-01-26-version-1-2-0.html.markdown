Submitted for your consideration, Solidus 1.2.0

This is a minor release of Solidus, the most major change is the location of the admin navigation, which is now on the left. It also contains many bug fixes and improvements.

--

*   Admin menu has been moved from top of the page to the left side.

    * Submenu items are accessible from any page. See [the wiki](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/wiki/Upgrading-Admin-Navigation-to-1.2)
       for more information and instructions on upgrading.
    * [Solidus_auth_devise](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus_auth_devise)
      should be updated to '~> 1.3' to support the new menu.
    * Added optional styles to the admin area to advance [admin rebrand](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/issues/520).
      To use the new colors, add `@import 'spree/backend/themes/blue_steel/globals/_variables_override';`
      to your `spree/backend/globals/variables_override`.

*   Removed deface requirement from core

    Projects and extensions which rely on deface will need to add it explicitly
    to their dependencies.

*   `testing_support/capybara_ext.rb` no longer changes capybara's matching
    mode to `:prefer_exact`, and instead uses capybara's default, `:smart`.

    You can restore the old behaviour (not recommended) by adding
    `Capybara.match = :prefer_exact` to your `spec_helper.rb`.

    More information can be found in [capybara's README](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara#matching)

*   Fixed a bug where sorting in the admin would not save positions correctly.
    [#632](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/632)

*   Included (VAT-style) taxes, will be considered applicable if they are
    inside the default tax zone, rather than just when they are the defaut tax
    zone. [#657](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/657)

*   Update jQuery.payment to v1.3.2 (from 1.0) [#608](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/608)

*   Removed Order::CurrencyUpdater. [#635](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/635)

*   Removed `Product#set_master_variant_defaults`, which was unnecessary since master is build with `is_master` already `true`.

*   Improved performance of stock packaging [#550](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/550) [#565](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/565) [#574](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/574)

*   Replaced admin taxon management interface [#569](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/569)

*   Fix logic around raising InsufficientStock when creating shipments. [#566](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/566)

    Previously, `InsufficientStock` was raised if any StockLocations were fully
    out of inventory. This was incorrect because it was possible other stock
    locations could have fulfilled the inventory. This was also incorrect because
    the stock location could have some, but insufficient inventory, and not raise
    the exception (an incomplete package would be returned). Now the coordinator
    checks that the package is complete and raises `InsufficientStock` if it is
    incomplete for any reason.

*   Support sprockets-rails 3.0 and greater
