Announcing Solidus 2.2.0!

This release includes better support for non-credit-card payment sources, better promotion creation, and many other great changes. 

Later this month is [SolidusConf 2017 in London](http://conf2017.solidus.io/). Hope to see you there!

### Major Changes

- Spree::Wallet and Non credit card payment sources [\#1707](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/1707) [\#1773](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/1773) [\#1765](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/1765) ([chrisradford](https://github.com/chrisradford), [jordan-brough](https://github.com/jordan-brough), [peterberkenbosch](https://github.com/peterberkenbosch))

  This adds support for payment sources other than `CreditCard`, which can be used to better represent other (potentially reusable) payment sources, like PayPal or Bank accounts. Previously sources like this had to implement all behaviour themselves, or try their best to quack like a credit card.

  This adds a `PaymentSource` base class, which `CreditCard` now inherits, and a `Wallet` service class to help manage users' payment sources. A `WalletPaymentSource` join table is used to tie reusable payment sources to users, replacing the existing behaviour of allowing all credit cards with a stored payment profile.

- Add promotion code batch [\#1524](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/1524) ([vladstoick](https://github.com/vladstoick))

  Prior to Solidus 1.0, each promotion had at most one code. Though we added the functionality to have many codes on one promotion, the UI for creation and management was lacking.

  In Solidus 2.2 we've added `PromotionCodeBatch`, a model to group a batch of promotion codes. This allows additional promotion codes to be generated after the Promotion's initial creation. Promotion codes are also now generated in a background job.

- Admin UI Changes

  The admin UI was once again a focus in this release. We've made many incremental changes we think all users will appreciate. This includes an upgrade to Bootstrap 4.0.0.alpha6, changes to table styles, and a better select style.

  See the "Admin UI" section below for a full list of changes.
