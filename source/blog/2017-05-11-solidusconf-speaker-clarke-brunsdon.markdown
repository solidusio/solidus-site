**Please give us a quick introduction for those who don't know you**

I'm one of the Solidus core team members and one of the founders of Stembolt. I've been a developer for the last 17 years, though nowadays I write more emails than code.

**What do you use Solidus for?**

At Stembolt we use Solidus on all of our projects. We split it up between new "greenfield" stores, stores we're upgrading from Spree, and stores that we're migrating from other platforms. I think we are involved in about a dozen Solidus stores at any given time.

**What is your talk going to be about?**

I'll be giving a Solidus "state of the union." I'll talk a bit about what has been accomplished since the last Solidus conference, where we are, and where we're going.

**What are you most looking forward to at SolidusConf?**

The hack days. There is nothing like sitting in a room full of developers that have all the same problems, questions, and concerns as you and ask them about how they've approached a problem and what kinds of solutions came up. The hack days are a fantastic, unstructured time to get to know new people, or work with people that you rarely get to see "IRL."

**Do you have any other plans for London?**

I'll be making the "nerd pilgrimage" with some of my co-workers to the [Doctor Who museum](http://www.visitcardiff.com/seedo/doctor-who-experience/) in Cardiff. I've already called shotgun on getting to make the "it's bigger on the inside!?" comment when entering the tardis.

**Thanks for your time!**

Looking forward to it!
